For this Lab we have selected the model **Mistral-7B Instruct v2**.(https://huggingface.co/mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2). This is a fully Open Source model (Apache 2.0 license), that although much lighter than other commercial or open source models is very capable, especially with the tasks we intend to use it for.\n",

For example, `max_new_tokens` will instruct the model to answer with a maximum of 512 tokens (words or parts of words). `temperature`, set really low here, will instruct the model to stay truth-grounded, and not try to be too \"creative\". After all, we're not trying to write a fancy poem here!"
