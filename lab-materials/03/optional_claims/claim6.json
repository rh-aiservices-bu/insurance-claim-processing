    "content": "Dear Westeros Insurance Claims Department,\nThis correspondence is from Tyrion Lannister, currently not in a tavern but rather dealing with the aftermath of an unpleasant vehicular incident. As a man known for resolving conflicts, I find myself ironically embroiled in one that requires your immediate attention.\n\nHere are the distressing details:\nOn April 15, 2023, at about noon, within the confines of King's Landing, my car was struck by another. As I navigated through the bustling streets near the marketplace, a distracted driver—likely admiring the view of the Blackwater Bay instead of the road—rammed into my car's side. This not only caused significant damage to the vehicle but also disrupted my travel plans significantly.\n\nNearly a month has elapsed since the accident, and yet, I've seen more action in the Small Council meetings than in the progress of my claim. Your lack of promptness in handling this matter is both noted and distressing. I require an exhaustive review and a swift update on my claim within the next 48 hours. This is not a mere request, but a necessity fueled by urgent needs and dwindling patience.\n\nPlease address this claim with the seriousness it merits. I expect a detailed response and a rapid resolution, or rest assured, further actions, potentially involving the Crown, will be considered.\n\nI await your expedited action,\nTyrion Lannister\n\nCC: Master of Coin\n\nAttach: Car Damage Photos, Eyewitness Accounts, Incident Report No. KL509"
