    "content": "Dear Stoneheart Insurance Claims Department,\n\nI am absolutely *thrilled* (read: infuriated) to be writing yet another heartfelt missive to the void that is your customer service. My recent car accident claim has vanished into the ether, much like my patience and the professionalism I expected from your company. How about we resolve this before the next ice age?\n\nLet's recap the blockbuster event:\nOn March 28, 2023, at around 4:15 PM, at the intersection of 5th Avenue and Main St in Springfield, my car was passionately sideswiped by another vehicle. Why? Because the other driver blasted through a red light and T-boned my car's passenger side. It was a harrowing scene, made worse by your glacial pace of response.\n\nIt's been over two weeks, and your commitment to delay is almost impressive. I demand a comprehensive review and prompt update on my claim within the next 24 hours. This isn't just a request—it's a necessity driven by sheer frustration and the urgent need for resolution.\n\nPlease treat this matter with the urgency it clearly deserves. I expect a detailed plan of action and a swift response, or be assured, further actions including legal recourse will be considered.\n\nLooking forward to an expedited resolution,\nSaul Goodman\n\nCC: My 17 Twitter Followers\n\nAttach: Police Report No. 12345, Photos of the Incident, Documented Calls and Emails"
