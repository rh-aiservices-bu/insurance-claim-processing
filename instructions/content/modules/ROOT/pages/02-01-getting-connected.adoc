= Getting connected

For the purposes of this training session, we have provisioned a shared OpenShift environment, with OpenShift AI deployed on it.
Each of you have your own accounts.

// Your permissions are higher than what you would get in production-grade environment so that you can see it all (Cluster-reader? downsides?)

Using the connecting details we provided you with, we will ask each of you to get connected to the environment.
* Log in to OpenShift Console
* Log in to OpenShift AI
* Confirm you can see the shared project called "llm-serving"
* Confirm you can create your own project playpen "userX-playpen"
