== Review of current claims processing
:slide:

* Claims can come in with multiple mediums:
** email
** fax
** phone
** web form
* All formats have to be transcribed into the web form

* Claims have to be processed by claims adjusters
** They spend an aggregated average of 7 hours/claim
** We estimate that human errors accounts for $2.5M/year in lost revenue
* Another $3.5M/year is likely lost due to fraud
* There are a lot of inefficiencies!
