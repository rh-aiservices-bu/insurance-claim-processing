= Creating your playpen project

As a preliminary step, each of you is going to
1. Create a project
2. Create a Data Connection
3. Launch a Workbench
4. Git-Clone the common repo

== Create a project

* Create a project like `userX-yourfirstname`
** that means that if Jane gets assigned user number 12, she should create a project called `user12-jane`
* Enter what you want in the description

== Create a Data Connection

* In your project, create a data connection that maps to the shared minio.
* Here is the info you need to enter:
** Name: `Shared Minio - pipelines`
** Access Key: `minio`
** Secret Key: `minio123`
** Endpoint: `minio.shared-minio.svc.cluster.local`
** Region: `none`
** Bucket: `bucket-user-01`

looks like:
