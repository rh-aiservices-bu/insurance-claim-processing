= Confidence-Check Pipeline
include::_attributes.adoc[]

== What will the pipeline do?
To make sure that everything works as we would expect it to, and that the model has not been tampered with, we will create a confidence-check pipeline that tests the model through its endpoint. +
We will test the response time, the response quality, and that the model hash has not changed. +
And to make sure it stays the same over time, we'll schedule that pipeline.

== Deploy a confidence-check pipeline

In the `parasol-insurance/lab-materials/03/06` folder there are two pipeline files, one `confidence_check.pipeline` and one `confidence_check.yaml` file.

The `.pipeline` file can be opened in Elyra to be visually modified and executed, while the `.yaml` file can be imported into the pipeline server through the RHOAI Dashboard. +
Here we will be running the pipeline through Elyra.

== Ad-Hoc execution

Running it through Elyra is the same as doing an ad-hoc execution of the pipeline, as opposed to importing the pipeline which won't automatically execute it.

. Start by going to your running workbench
. Navigate to the folder `parasol-insurance/lab-materials/03/06`
. Open up the `confidence_check.pipeline` file
. Here we can see that the pipeline consists of 3 checks:
.. response quality check
.. response time check
.. security check
. Feel free to peek into each of the python files by double clicking on the nodes to see what they do. +
. After the tests have been run, we have a final function that will summarize the results and log them.
. To run the pipeline, press the Play button in the menu bar.

. When you get a popup that says **Job submission to Data Science Pipelines succeeded**, click the link **Run details** to see how the pipeline is progressing.

== Schedule execution

We can also **schedule** an execution so that the confidence check is executed at regular intervals. +
To do that:

. Go back to the {rhoai} Data Science Project
. Find the pipeline you just ran
. Click the 3 dots at the very end of the line, and click "Create run".

. On the next screen, choose a name, select a Periodic run to trigger every **Day** and click **Create**:

. We can now leave the confidence-check pipeline alone.
. It will run daily, and will inform us if anything goes wrong with our LLM.
