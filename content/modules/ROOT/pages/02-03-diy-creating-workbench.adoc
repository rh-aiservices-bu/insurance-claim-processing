* Make sure it has the following characteristics:
** Choose a name for it, like: `My Workbench`
** Image Selection: `CUSTOM - {ic} Workbench`
** Container Size: `Standard`
** Accelerator: `None`
* That should look like:

NOTE: You should **not** need to modify any other Workbench settings (such as Storage)
* Wait for your workbench to be fully started

== Git-Clone the common repo

We will clone the content of our Git repo so that you can access all the materials that were created as part of our prototyping exercise.

* Using the Git UI:
** Open the Git UI in Jupyter:
