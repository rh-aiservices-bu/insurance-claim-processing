= Potential Improvements and Refinements
include::_attributes.adoc[]

== To the {ic} materials

If you have any feedback regarding this {ic}, please use https://github.com/rh-aiservices-bu/insurance-claim-processing/issues[Issues,window=_blank] and https://github.com/rh-aiservices-bu/insurance-claim-processing/pulls[Pull Requests,window=_blank].

But this section of the {ic} is not meant for Improvements and Refinements **to the lab**. Instead it is about...

== To the presented prototype

What we have shown in this {ic} is a very rough prototype, put together very quickly, in order to demonstrate:

* Which improvements could be done
* How long it would take to do them

In such a situation, it is common to go fast and make short-term decisions since there is no guarantee that this will become a real project.

Therefore, now, we need to review what was done, and make suggestions along these axes.

* What **other** tools and techniques could be used in order to make the experience of our claims adjusters even better, more streamlined?

* Is our current application robust enough? Describe what scenarios might make it harder to use?

* How efficiently are we going to be able to make updates to its components if we need to? Is there a chance that making a change to the LLM model, the YOLOV8 model, the database, the application, will introduce breaking changes?

* If that is the case, what would we want to do to avoid those risks?

* Which parts seem to still be manual and time-consuming, and how could we automate them better, to avoid human errors if we can.

**Think about these questions first**

* We could have something that analyzes the images and checks for discrepancies with the customer data, such as:
** Not the same make or color car as what is on file.
** Mismatch in license plate, if visible in the picture.
* We've only scratched the surface with gitops and pipelines here
** There was no performance testing done. If too many users connect at the same time, it might overwhelm either the app, the database, the LLM, etc...
* Currently, most simple changes would probably end up breaking the application. And the person who, for example decides to change Mistral7B for Flan-T5-Small would not necessarily realize that.
** It would be critical to have multiple instances (Dev/Test/UAT/Prod) of the application.
** It would also be required to have integration pipelines run in these environments to confirm that changes made do not break the overall application.
* We could ask the LLM to start writing a response to the customer.
** It could be just to ask for missing details.
** or it could be to let them know whether the claim is accepted or denied.
* However, to do this, the LLM would have to be aware of the policies that the insurance company uses to make those determinations.
** This could be an interesting use-case for the https://research.ibm.com/blog/retrieval-augmented-generation-RAG[RAG,window=_blank] approach.
