= Potential Improvements and Refinements

== To the lab materials

Although we welcome feedback, critique, we prefer https://github.com/rh-aiservices-bu/insurance-claim-processing/issues[Issues] and https://github.com/rh-aiservices-bu/insurance-claim-processing/pulls[Pull Requests].

But this section of the lab is not meant for Improvements and Refinements to the lab. Instead it is about...

== To the presented prototype

What we have showed in this lab is a very rough prototype, put together very quickly, in order to demonstrate:

* what could be done
* that it was do-able at all

In such a situation, it's common to cut corners and make short term decisions since there is no garantee that this will become a real project.
