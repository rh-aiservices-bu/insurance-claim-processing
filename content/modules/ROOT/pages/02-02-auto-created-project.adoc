= Pre-Created project and pipeline server
include::_attributes.adoc[]

In order to give you a feel for what "day 2" experience would be like, we have pre-created a Project for you, and started to populate it with various artifacts.

// If you want to learn more about the product and go deeper, the next ("DIY") section will walk you through the steps required to create all this from scratch instead.

== Go to your project

* First, in the {rhoai} Dashboard application, navigate to the Data Science Projects menu on the left:

* Then, open the project called {user}.

* Inside the project you should see a few items that already have been pre-created:

* These components are as follows:
1. A Workbench - this is your environment that you can experiment and train in.
2. A Cluster storage - this is a persistent storage for your workbench.
3. A Data Connection - it contains all the information needed to talk with an existing S3 storage, we use that to store models and pipeline artifacts.
4. A Pipeline Server - the pipeline server has already been set up here so you can import or run data science pipelines right away.
