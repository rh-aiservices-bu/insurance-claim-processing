= Pre-Created project and pipeline server
include::_attributes.adoc[]

In order to give you a feel for what "day 2" experience would be like, we have pre-created a Project for you, and started to populate it with various artifacts.

// If you want to learn more about the product and go deeper, the next ("DIY") section will walk you through the steps required to create all this from scratch instead.

== Go to your project

* First, in the {rhoai} Dashboard application, navigate to the Data Science Projects menu on the left:

* These components are as follows:
** A Workbench - this is your environment that you can experiment and train in.
** A Cluster storage - this is a persistent storage for your workbench.
** A Data Connection - it contains all the information needed to talk with an existing S3 storage, we use that to store models and pipeline artifacts.
** A Pipeline Server - the pipeline server has already been set up here so you can import or run pipelines right away.
