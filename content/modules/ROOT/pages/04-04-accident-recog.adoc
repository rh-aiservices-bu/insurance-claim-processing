Now that we have retrained our model we can test it against our 'test' images. But where is our re-trained model located? 

When training started, a 'runs/detect/train' folder was created. After each epoch, a trained model is exported to /runs/detect/train/weights/last.pt file.  The re-trained model with the highest precision is exported to /runs/detect/train/weights/best.pt.  As you were unable to execute the re-training of the model, we created a 'models' folder and placed the best.pt model into that folder.

. In your running pytorch workbench, navigate to the folder `lab-materials/04`.

. Look for (and open) the notebook called `04-04-accident-recog.ipynb`

. Execute the cells of the notebook.

Note:  to download the version of the model that has been retrained, use this:

[.lines_space]
[.console-input]
[source, text]
[subs=attributes+]
curl -LO https://rhods-public.s3.amazonaws.com/demo-models/ic-models/accident/accident_detect.onnx

Using the re-trained model, on the below image, we see that the model is able to identify a 'severe' car crash with '88%' probability.
