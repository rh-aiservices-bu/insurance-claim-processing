== Deploy your instance of ArgoCD

We will start by deploying an instance of ArgoCD in your namespace. +
This will be used to deploy the rest of the applications.

- Copy the content of the following text, and paste it in the OpenShift Terminal to deploy ArgoCD.
+
[.lines_space]
[.console-input]
[source, text]
cat <<EOF | oc apply -f -
---
apiVersion: argoproj.io/v1alpha1
kind: ArgoCD
metadata:
  name: argocd
spec:
  sso:
    dex:
      openShiftOAuth: true
      resources:
        limits:
          cpu: 500m
          memory: 256Mi
        requests:

- Still in the Terminal, run the following command to check the status of the ArgoCD deployment.
+
[.lines_space]
[.console-input]
[source, text]
oc rollout status deploy/argocd-server

- After a few seconds, the deployment should be complete:

**Optional**: connect to the ArgoCD UI
If you know and understand ArgoCD and want to look at its interface ...
[%collapsible]
====
Now that Argo is deployed, you can connect to its UI through its Route.

- Let's find the Route of the ArgoCD instance by running the following command in the Terminal:
+
[.lines_space]
[.console-input]
[source, text]
echo "   ArgoCD UI : https://$(oc get route argocd-server -ojsonpath='{.status.ingress[0].host}')/ "

- You should obtain something like this:
+
[.bordershadow]
image::05/argocd-route.png[]

- You can now connect to the ArgoCD UI using your given credentials ({user}/{password}).
====

== Deploy the applications via GitOps

Now that ArgoCD is deployed in your namespace, we can use it to deploy the application via GitOps.

- Copy the content of the following text, and paste it in the OpenShift Terminal to deploy the application.
+
[.lines_space]
[.console-input]
[source, text, subs="attributes+"]
cat <<EOF | oc apply -f -
---
apiVersion: argoproj.io/v1alpha1
kind: Application
metadata:
  name: claim-insurance-app
spec:
  destination:
    server: https://kubernetes.default.svc
    namespace: {user}
  project: default
  source:
    path: lab-materials/05/app
    repoURL: https://github.com/rh-aiservices-bu/insurance-claim-processing.git
    targetRevision: dev
  syncPolicy:
    automated:
      prune: true
      selfHeal: false
    syncOptions: [CreateNamespace=false]
EOF


- Once the application is deployed, you can check its Route with the following command:
+
[.lines_space]
[.console-input]
[.lines_space]
[.console-input]
[source, text]
echo "   Application URL : https://$(oc get route ic-app -ojsonpath='{.status.ingress[0].host}')/ "

Open the URL in your browser to access the application and head for the next step.
