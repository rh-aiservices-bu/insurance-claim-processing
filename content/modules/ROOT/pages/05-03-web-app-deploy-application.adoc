== Deploy your instance of {argocd}

We will start by deploying an instance of ArgoCD in your namespace. +
This will be used to deploy the application.

- Copy the following text, and paste it in the {ocp-short} Terminal to deploy {argocd}.
+
[.lines_space]
[.console-input]
[source, text]
cat <<EOF | oc apply -f -

apiVersion: argoproj.io/v1alpha1
kind: ArgoCD
metadata:
  name: argocd

          memory: 256Mi

- Still in the Terminal, run the following command to check the status of the {argocd} deployment.
+
[.lines_space]
[.console-input]
[source, text]
oc rollout status deploy/argocd-server

- After a few seconds, the deployment should be complete:

**Optional**: If you know and understand {argocd} and want to look at its interface, look at the following details. Otherwise, you can skip to the next step.

====
Now that Argo is deployed, you can connect to its UI through its Route.

- Let's find the Route of the {argocd} instance by running the following command in the Terminal:
+
[.lines_space]
[.console-input]
[source, text]
echo "   {argocd} UI : https://$(oc get route argocd-server -ojsonpath='{.status.ingress[0].host}')/ "

- You should obtain something like this:
+

- You can now connect to the ArgoCD UI using your given credentials ({user}/{password}).

== Deploy the application(s) via GitOps

Now that {argocd} is deployed in your namespace, we can use it to deploy the application via GitOps.

- Copy the content of the following text, and paste it in the {ocp-short} Terminal to deploy the application.
+
[.lines_space]
[.console-input]
[source, text, subs="attributes+"]
cat <<EOF | oc apply -f -

apiVersion: argoproj.io/v1alpha1
kind: Application
metadata:
  name: claim-insurance-app
spec:
  destination:
    server: https://kubernetes.default.svc
    namespace: {user}
  project: default
  source:
    path: lab-materials/05/app
    repoURL: https://github.com/rh-aiservices-bu/insurance-claim-processing.git

      selfHeal: false
    syncOptions: [CreateNamespace=false]

- Wait for the application to be fully deployed and initialized. It will be the case when the two Jobs `db-init-job` and `populate-images` are completed (Completions: 1 of 1).

- Once the application is deployed, you can check its Route with the following command:
+
[.lines_space]
[.console-input]
[.lines_space]
[.console-input]
[source, text]
echo "   Application URL : https://$(oc get route ic-app -ojsonpath='{.status.ingress[0].host}')/ "

Open the the URL in your browser to access the application and head to the next step.
