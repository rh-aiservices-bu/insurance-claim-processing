== Lab Overview

This lab will illustrate how the use of various AI/ML technologies can be combined to produce a valuable solution to a business problem.

The information, code, models and techniques it contains are illustrations of what a first prototype could look like. It is not the definitive way of addressing the stated requirements.

== Disclaimer

This lab is an example of what a customer could build using OpenShift AI. OpenShift AI has no specific feature related to Insurance Claim Processing.

This lab makes use of large language models (LLM) and image processing models. These models are not included in the OpenShift AI product. They are provided as a convenience for this lab.

The quality of these models is enough for a prototype. Choosing the right model to use in a production environment is a complex task that requires a lot of experimentation and tuning. This lab does not cover this aspect.

== Timetable

This is a tentative timetable for the materials that will be presented today.
