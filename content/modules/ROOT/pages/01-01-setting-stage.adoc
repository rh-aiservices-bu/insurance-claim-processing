= Setting the stage

In order to make this lab seem more realistic, we will be describing this imaginary scenario.

== Situation
:slide:

* We all work for a large multi-national insurance company
** Our company is in the midst of digital transformation
** It is looking at modernizing practices and leveraging new technologies
* A small team was asked to:
** review the way insurance claims are currently being processed
** provide advice on potential improvements
* That team is currently very small (about 4 people)
** Findings will be presented to the board
** If they are convincing, we'll be granted the resources to implement the recommendations
* The next slides are the materials that were presented to the board
