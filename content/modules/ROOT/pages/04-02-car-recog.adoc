In our last notebook we confirmed that the YOLO model could identify cars in a photograph.

We also confirmed that while a YOLO model can identify multiple 'cars' in an image, humans may have a difficult time verifying the identified cars.

In the above image, the yolo model identified 17 cars and 1 truck.  Which cars ,in the above image, were identified?

Therefore we need to write some code that will place 'boxes' around the 'cars' identified by the YOLO model.

- In your running pytorch workbench, navigate to the folder `lab-materials/04`.
- Look for (and open) the notebook called `04-02-car-recognition.ipynb`
- Execute the cells of the notebook, and ensure you understand what is happening
