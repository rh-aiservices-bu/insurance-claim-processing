. At this point, we need to deploy the model into RHOAI model serving.
. Look at the information used to create the Data Connection that was used for the pipeline server.

. Re-create another data connection, with identical information, but change the bucket name from `userX` to 'models'

== Create a Data Connection

* In your project, create a data connection that maps to the shared minio.
* Here is the info you need to enter:
** Name:
[.lines_space]
[.console-input]
[source, text]
[subs=attributes+]
Shared Minio - model
** Access Key:
[.lines_space]
[.console-input]
[source, text]
[subs=attributes+]
{minio-user}
** Secret Key:
[.lines_space]
[.console-input]
[source, text]
[subs=attributes+]
{minio-pass}
** Endpoint:
[.lines_space]
[.console-input]
[source, text]
[subs=attributes+]
{minio-endpoint}
** Region:
[.lines_space]
[.console-input]
[source, text]
[subs=attributes+]
none
** Bucket:
[.lines_space]
[.console-input]
[source, text]
[subs=attributes+]
models

* The result should look like:

== Create a Model Server

In your project create a model server.

* Click 'Add server'

My first Model Server
** Serving runtime:
[.lines_space]
[.console-input]

OpenVINO Model Server
** Number of model server replicas to deploy:

[.console-input]
[source, text]

unchecked
** Token authorization

== Deploy the Model

In your project, under 'Models and model servers' select 'Deploy model'.

* Click 'Deploy model'

If the model is successfully deployed you will see its status as green.

Now confirm that the model is working!

== Confirm the Model is working
Once the model has been deployed, we need to confirm that the model is working in model mesh.


. In your running pytorch workbench, navigate to the folder `lab-materials/04`.

. Look for (and open) the notebook called `04-05-serving-mannual.ipynb`.

. Execute the cells of the notebook, and ensure you understand what is happening.
