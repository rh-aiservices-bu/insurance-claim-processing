Now that you are connected to your workbench, let's make sure that all the expected services are responding properly in the cluster.

In your workbench:

. In the left hand navigation menu, navigate to the folder called: `lab-materials/02`

. Open the notebook called `02-03-validating.ipynb`

. Running these cells will confirm that all the lab-required services are responding.

If the output of this notebook looks suspicious, please inform the people leading the lab.
