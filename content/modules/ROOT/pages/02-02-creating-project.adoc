= Creating your playpen project
:imagesdir: ../assets/images

As a preliminary step, each of you is going to

. Create a project

. Create a Data Connection

. Launch a Workbench

. Git-Clone the common repo

== Unique user ID

* If you are using instructions that have been customized for you, here are your details:
** User id: `{user}`
** Password: `{password}`
** OpenShift Console URL: {openshift_console_url}
** Hello {user} your password is {password} and your url for your console is {openshift_console_url}[{openshift_console_url}]
* Otherwise, use the user id that you've claimed in the Lab Worksheet

== Create a project

* Create a project based on the user ID that was assigned to you. (such as `userX`)
* Enter your first and last name in the description of the project.

It should look like this:

image::02/02-02-create-project.png[]

But should NOT be `userX`. (`X` should be a number instead)

== Create a Data Connection

* In your project, create a data connection that maps to the shared minio.
* Here is the info you need to enter:
** Name:
[.lines_space]
[.console-input]
[source, text]
[subs=attributes+]
Shared Minio - pipelines
** Access Key:
[.lines_space]
[.console-input]
[source, text]
[subs=attributes+]
{minio-user}
** Secret Key:
[.lines_space]
[.console-input]
[source, text]
[subs=attributes+]
{minio-pass}
** Endpoint:
[.lines_space]
[.console-input]
[source, text]
[subs=attributes+]
{minio-endpoint}
** Region:
[.lines_space]
[.console-input]
[source, text]
[subs=attributes+]
none
** Bucket:
[.lines_space]
[.console-input]
[source, text]
[subs=attributes+]
userX

The result should look like:

image::02/data-connection.png[]


== Launch a Workbench

Once the Data Connection is created, launch a workbench with the following characteristics:

* Choose a name for it
* Image Selection: Pytorch
* Version: 2023.2
* Container Size: Small
* Accelerator: None
