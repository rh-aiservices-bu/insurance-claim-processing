= Creating your playpen project
:imagesdir: ../assets/images

As a preliminary step, each of you is going to

. Create a project

. Create a Data Connection

. Launch a Workbench

. Git-Clone the common repo

== Unique user ID

* If you are using instructions that have been customized for you, here are your details:
** User id: `{user}`
** Password: `{password}`
** OpenShift Console URL: {openshift_console_url}

== Create a project

* Create a project with the same name as your user id.
** You have been assigned a user in the form of `{user}`
** Create a project with that exact name
* Leave the resource name unchanged
* Enter your first and last name in the description of the project.

It should look like this:

image::02/02-02-create-project.png[]

But should NOT be `userX`. (for you, `X` should be a number instead)

== Create a Data Connection

* We have deployed an instance of Minio in the cluster to act as a simple Object Storage for our purposes.
* We will create a **Data Connection** to it.
* Here is the info you need to enter:
** Name:
[.lines_space]
[.console-input]
[source, text]
[subs=attributes+]
Shared Minio - pipelines
** Access Key:
[.lines_space]
[.console-input]
[source, text]
[subs=attributes+]
{minio-user}
** Secret Key:
[.lines_space]
[.console-input]
[source, text]
[subs=attributes+]
{minio-pass}
** Endpoint:
[.lines_space]
[.console-input]
[source, text]
[subs=attributes+]
{minio-endpoint}
** Region:
[.lines_space]
[.console-input]
[source, text]
[subs=attributes+]
none
** Bucket:
[.lines_space]
[.console-input]
[source, text]
[subs=attributes+]
{user}

The result should look like:

== Launch a Workbench

Once the Data Connection is created, launch a workbench with the following characteristics:

* Choose a name for it
* Image Selection: Pytorch
* Version: 2023.2
* Container Size: Small
* Accelerator: None

Once the Workbench is created and running, Connect to it. (You will be asked to authenticate again, and accept some settings)

== Git-Clone the common repo

There are 2 potential ways of cloning the git repo into your workbench. Choose the one you are most comfortable with.
