= Creating your playpen project
include::_attributes.adoc[]

As a preliminary step, each of you is going to

. Create a Data Science project
  * this will help keep your things together

. Create a Data Connection
  * we need that for the pipeline server to store it artifacts

. Deploy a Data Science Pipeline Server
  * we will need one, and it's better to create it from the start

. Launch a Workbench
  * we will use it to review content and notebooks

. Clone the git repo into your Workbench
  * this contains all the code we've been using in our protoyping efforts

The instructions below will guide you through these steps. Follow them carefully.

== Unique user ID

* If you are using instructions that have been customized for you, here are your details:
** User id: `{user}`
** Password: `{password}`
** RHOAI URL: https://rhods-dashboard-redhat-ods-applications.{openshift_cluster_ingress_domain}/[https://rhods-dashboard-redhat-ods-applications.{openshift_cluster_ingress_domain}/,window=_blank]

== Create a project

* First, navigate to the Data Science Project menu on the left:
+

* Create a project with the **same name** as your user id.
** You have been assigned a unique user ID:  `{user}`
** You need to now create a project with the exact same name: `{user}`

IMPORTANT: Your assigned user is {user}. Don't mess that up or things will break later on

* Leave the resource name unchanged
* Enter your first and last name in the description of the project.

It should look like this:

[.bordershadow]
image::02/02-02-create-project.png[]

IMPORTANT: But it should NOT be `userX` like in the screenshot. (for you, `X` should be a number instead)

== Create a Data Connection for the pipeline server

* We have deployed an instance of Minio in the cluster to act as a simple Object Storage for our purposes.
* We will create a **Data Connection** to it.
* Here is the info you need to enter:
** Name:
[.lines_space]
[.console-input]
[source, text]
[subs=attributes+]
Shared Minio - pipelines
** Access Key:
[.lines_space]
[.console-input]
[source, text]
[subs=attributes+]
{minio-user}
** Secret Key:
[.lines_space]
[.console-input]
[source, text]
[subs=attributes+]
{minio-pass}
** Endpoint:
[.lines_space]
[.console-input]
[source, text]
[subs=attributes+]
{minio-endpoint}
** Region:
[.lines_space]
[.console-input]
[source, text]
[subs=attributes+]
none
** Bucket:
[.lines_space]
[.console-input]
[source, text]
[subs=attributes+]
{user}

IMPORTANT: Once again, the bucket you will use has to match with the user ID you were provided

The result should look like:

== Create a Pipeline Server

It is highly recommended to create your pipeline server before creating a workbench. So let's do that now!

* In your DS project, click on **Create a pipeline Server**
+
[.bordershadow]
image::02/02-02-pipelineserver01.png[]

* Select the Data Connection created earlier (**Shared Minio - pipelines**) and click the **configure** button:
+
[.bordershadow]
image::02/02-02-pipelineserver02.png[]

* When your pipeline server is ready, your screen will look like the following:
+
[.bordershadow]
image::02/02-02-pipelineserver03.png[]

At this point, your pipeline server is ready and deployed.

IMPORTANT: You need to wait until that screen is ready. If it's still spinning, wait for it to complete. If you continue and create your workbench **before** the pipeline server is ready, your workbench will not be able to submit pipelines to it.

== Launch a Workbench

Once the Data Connection and Pipeline Server are created, create a workbench with the following characteristics:

* Choose a name for it, like: `My Workbench`
* Image Selection: `Insurance Claim Processing Lab Workbench`
* Container Size: Standard
* Accelerator: None

[.bordershadow]
image::02/02-02-launch-workbench-01.png[]

* Wait for your workbench to be fully started
* Once it is, click the **Open** Link to connect to it.
* Authenticate with the same credentials as earlier
* You will be asked to accept these settings:
+

image::02/02-02-accept.png[]

* Do so.
* You should now see this:

== Git-Clone the common repo

There are 2 potential ways of cloning the git repo into your workbench. Choose the one you are most comfortable with.

====
Using the Git UI::

If you want to use the git UI in Jupyter:

[.bordershadow]

Enter the URL of the Git repo:

[.console-input]
[source,adoc]
[subs=attributes+]
----
{git-clone-repo-url}

Using the Git CLI::

If you prefer using the `git` CLI, open a a terminal in JupyterLab, and paste this code:

[.console-input]
[source,adoc]
[subs=attributes+]
----
git clone {git-clone-repo-url}
cd insurance-claim-processing/
git checkout {git-clone-repo-branch}
----
--
====

At this point, your project is ready for the work we want to do in it.
