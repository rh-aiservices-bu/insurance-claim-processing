= Pipeline for processing claims
include::_attributes.adoc[]

== What will the pipeline do?
Now that we have the web app deployed, we need some way to process the claims in the web app. For that, we will use a pipeline that either can run ad-hoc or be scheduled just like the sanity check pipeline. +
This pipeline is also a good starting point for creating an ArgoCD or Tekton pipeline which can be automatically triggered.

== What's inside the pipeline?
If you naviage to `lab-materials/05/05-05/` you can see a variety of files. +
Just like before, we have both an Elyra version and a yaml version of the pipeline. This time, we will use the yaml file of the pipeline, which has been slightly customized to be able to run independently of Elyra. +
Here are the main files of the pipeline and what they do:

* *get_claims* - Will connect to the database, fetch any unprocessed claims, and add them to a list that will be passed to the other tasks through a file `claims.json`.
* The following will go through all the claims and use the full body of the text to try and find some important feature, then push that to the database:
** *get_location* - Finds the location of the accident.
** *get_accident_time* - Finds the time of the accident.
** *summarize_text* - Makes a short summary of the text.
** *get_sentiment* - Gets the sentiment of the text.
* *detect_objects* - Downloads the images of the claims and uses the served object-detection model to find damages in the image.

== Create a new PVC
Before we can run the pipeline, we need to create a PVC it can use to store file and results in. +
Go to the OpenShift Console and navigate to Storage ->  PersistantStorageClaims.

Make sure you are in the right project (your username) and then press `Create PersistantVolumeClaim`.

* Use these settings:
** StorageClass:
[.lines_space]
[.console-input]
[source, text]
[subs=attributes+]
ocs-storagecluster-cephfs
** PersistentVolumeClaim name:
[.lines_space]
[.console-input]
[source, text]
[subs=attributes+]
processing-pipeline-storage
** Access mode:
[.lines_space]
[.console-input]
[source, text]
[subs=attributes+]
Shared access (RWX)
** Size:
[.lines_space]
[.console-input]
[source, text]
[subs=attributes+]
1 GiB

Then press `Create`.

== Run the pipeline
To run the pipeline, start by downloading the `process_claims.yaml` file locally. +
Then go to your Data Science project and press Import Pipeline.

[.bordershadow]
image::05/05-import-pipeline-button.png[import pipeline]

Now upload process_claims.yaml file, either by drag-and-dropping or using the Upload button. Then make sure to give your pipeline a good name like `Process Claims Pipeline`. +
It should look something like this afterwards:

[.bordershadow]

Press `Import Pipeline` and you should see it pop up under your pipelines.

Now go into the settings at the right side and press Create Run to create a new run of the pipeline you just added.

[.bordershadow]
image::05/05-create-run.png[create run]

* Use these settings:
** Name:
[.lines_space]
[.console-input]
[source, text]
[subs=attributes+]
Process Claim Run
** Run type:
[.lines_space]
[.console-input]
[source, text]
[subs=attributes+]
Run once immediately after creation
** claim_id:
[.lines_space]
[.console-input]
[source, text]
[subs=attributes+]
3
** detection_endpoint:
[.lines_space]
[.console-input]
[source, text]
[subs=attributes+]
http://modelmesh-serving.{user}:8008

This is the same route to the object detection endpoint that was used earlier in the workshop. +
When done it should look something like this:

[.bordershadow]
image::05/05-run-settings-create-pipeline.png[run settings]

Note that by changing claim_id you can change which claim to process. If you set it to 0 it will process all unprocessed claims.

Press `Create` and watch it go.

== Check the results
After the pipeline has finished running, you can go to the app and take a look at the claims. +
Instead of just a long body, you will now see a summary, a location field, an accident time field, and a sentiment field. +
You can also see that we have new image(s) which have bounding boxes where the damage is.
