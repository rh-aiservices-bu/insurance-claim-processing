Now that you are connected to your workbench, let's make sure that all the expected services are responding properly in the cluster.

In your workbench:

. In the left hand navigation menu, navigate to the folder called: `parasol-insurance/lab-materials/02`

. Open the notebook called `02-05-validating.ipynb`

. If you have never executed Cells in a Jupyter Notebook before, here is what you need to do:

.. Click on the **Restart kernel and Run all Cells** link:

. Running these cells will confirm that all the lab-required services are responding.

The output should look as follows:

[source,console]
