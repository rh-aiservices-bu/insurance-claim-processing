= Getting connected

For the purposes of this training session, we have provisioned a shared OpenShift environment, with OpenShift AI deployed on it.
Each of you have your own accounts.

// Your permissions are higher than what you would get in production-grade environment so that you can see it all (Cluster-reader? downsides?)

The people facilitating the lab will share a URL with you.

Once you open it, you will see something that looks like the following:

== Your private user and password

TODO: image of what that looks like

TODO: claim your user: how to

TODO: Figure out the OpenShift/OpenShift AI URL

== Connecting to OpenShift Console

* Click on the URL
* Choose the Auth Provider called:
* Enter your user `userX` where  `X` is between 1 and 50
* Enter your provided password

== Connecting to OpenShift AI

* Same steps for auth

== Other (shared) credentials:

* ArgoCD view
* Gitea
* Database
