For the purposes of this training session, we have provisioned a single OpenShift cluster, with OpenShift AI deployed on it.

Each person attending this lab will have a unique user account in which to do their work.

// Your permissions are higher than what you would get in production-grade environment so that you can see it all (Cluster-reader? downsides?)

// The people facilitating the lab will share a URL with you. This URL will provide you with

// * The cluster's URLs
// * Your account id (like `userX` where `X` is a number)
// * Your password (likely to be `openshift`) for that account
// * a link to a **customized** version of these instructions.

// Once you open it, you will see something that looks like the following:

== Environment information

If you are using the customized version of the instructions, the information below will render properly. If not, you will see placeholder values instead.

* Your account id: `{user}`
* Your password: `{password}`

In a new window or tab, open the following URL and log in:

* OpenShift Console URL: {openshift_console_url}[{openshift_console_url},window=_blank]
The result should look like:
+
image::02/02-01-login1.png[]

* and after that:
+
image::02/02-01-login2.png[]

Now, open the OpenShift AI URL, and log in with the same credentials:

* The RHOAI URL: https://rhods-dashboard-redhat-ods-applications.{openshift_cluster_ingress_domain}/[https://rhods-dashboard-redhat-ods-applications.{openshift_cluster_ingress_domain}/,window=_blank]
* Maybe this URL will work better in Showroom:
** https://rhods-dashboard-redhat-ods-applications.{openshift_cluster_ingress_domain}/["https://rhods-dashboard-redhat-ods-applications.{openshift_cluster_ingress_domain}/",window=_blank]

* Alternatively, you can access Red Hat OpenShift AI from the OpenShift Console by clicking on:

* After you authenticate, the result should look like:

// * The `oc login` command:
// [.lines_space]
// [.console-input]
// [source, text]
// [subs=attributes+]
// {login_command}



// == Other credentials and URLs:

// TODO?

// * ArgoCD view
// * Gitea
// * Database
