For the purposes of this training session, we have provisioned a single {ocp} cluster, with {rhoai} deployed on it.

Each person attending this lab will have a unique user account in which to do their work.

== Environment information

If you are using the customized version of the instructions, the information below will render properly. If not, you will see placeholder values instead.

* Your account id: `{user}`
* Your password: `{password}`

In a new window or tab, open the following URL and log in:

* The {rhoai} Dashboard URL for our shared environment:
** https://rhods-dashboard-redhat-ods-applications.{openshift_cluster_ingress_domain}/[https://rhods-dashboard-redhat-ods-applications.{openshift_cluster_ingress_domain}/,window=_blank]
* Enter your credentials (as detailed above)
* The result should look like:
+

* Because the password is so simple (`{password}`), your browser might display a scary message such as:
+
[.bordershadow]
image::02/02-01-login-scary.png[]
* It is safe here to ignore this message when it pops up.

* After you authenticate, the result should look like:
+

If you got this far and saw all that, congratulations, you properly connected to the {rhoai} Dashboard Application!

We are now ready to start the {ic}.

== Getting Support during Red Hat Summit

* In the room:
** Some very kind colleagues of ours will be walking around in the room, to help and/or answer questions.
** If you run into a particular issue, call out to one of them and quietly explain what the issue is.

// ** If they are unsure or if it's likely to be a long explanation, they might ask you to "post the question in slack" instead. (see below)
// * Over Slack:
// ** We have a dedicated Slack Channel where more colleagues (who kindly agreed to stay up late) will try to answer questions.
// ** Head over to the slack channel called https://redhat.enterprise.slack.com/archives/C066EQ8LWBS[#rh1-insurance-claims-lab,window=_blank]
// ** Post a message such as `I am userX and I have an issue with exercise number 2.4`
// ** Use the https://slack.com/help/articles/115000769927-Use-threads-to-organize-discussions-[threads,window=_blank] feature in slack to then post a screenshot of a description of the issue, in-thread.
