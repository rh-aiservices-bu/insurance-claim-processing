= Getting connected

For the purposes of this training session, we have provisioned a single OpenShift cluster, with OpenShift AI deployed on it.

Each person attending this lab will have a unique user account in which to do their work.

// Your permissions are higher than what you would get in production-grade environment so that you can see it all (Cluster-reader? downsides?)

The people facilitating the lab will share a URL with you. This URL will provide you with

* The cluster's URLs
* Your account id (like `userX` where `X` is a number)
* Your password (likely to be `openshift`) for that account
* a link to a **customized** version of these instructions.

Once you open it, you will see something that looks like the following:

== Customized environment information

If you are using the customized version of the instructions, the information below will render properly. If not, you will see variable names surrounded by curly braces (`{}`).

* OpenShift Console URL: {openshift_console_url}[{openshift_console_url},window=_blank]
* Your account id: `{user}`
* Your password: `{password}`
* The RHOAI URL:
** https://rhods-dashboard-redhat-ods-applications.{openshift_cluster_ingress_domain}/[https://rhods-dashboard-redhat-ods-applications.{openshift_cluster_ingress_domain}/,window=_blank]
* The `oc login` command:
[.lines_space]
[.console-input]
[source, text]
[subs=attributes+]
{login_command}

// TODO: image of what that looks like

// TODO: claim your user: how to

// TODO: Figure out the OpenShift/OpenShift AI URL

== Connecting to OpenShift Console

* Click on the OpenShift Console URL above
* Choose the Auth Provider called **HTpasswd**.
* Enter your user id `userX` where `X` is a number.
* Enter your provided password (`openshift`)

== Connecting to OpenShift AI

* Once you are connected to the OpenShift Console:
** Click on the App Switcher Icon
** Then Navigate to OpenShift AI



== Other credentials and URLs:

TODO?

* ArgoCD view
* Gitea
* Database
