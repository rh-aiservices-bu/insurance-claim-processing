= Getting connected
include::_attributes.adoc[]

For the purposes of this training session, we have provisioned a single OpenShift cluster, with OpenShift AI deployed on it.

Each person attending this lab will have a unique user account in which to do their work.

== Getting Support during RH1 In-Person Labs

* In the room
** Some very kind colleagues will be walking around in the room, to help and/or answer questions.
** If you run into a particular issue, call out to one of them and quietly explain what the issue is.
** If they are unsure or if it's likely to be a long explanation, they might ask you to "post the question in slack" instead. (see below)
* Over slack
** We have a dedicated Slack Channel where more colleagues (who kindly agreed to stay up late) will try to answer questions.
** Head over to the slack channel called https://redhat.enterprise.slack.com/archives/C066EQ8LWBS,window=_blank[#rh1-insurance-claims-lab]
** Post a message such as `I have an issue with exercise number 2.4`
** Use the https://slack.com/help/articles/115000769927-Use-threads-to-organize-discussions-,window=_blank[threads] feature in slack to then post a screenshot of a description of the issue, in-thread.

== Environment information

If you are using the customized version of the instructions, the information below will render properly. If not, you will see placeholder values instead.

* Your account id: `{user}`
* Your password: `{password}`

In a new window or tab, open the following URL and log in:

// * OpenShift Console URL: {openshift_console_url}[{openshift_console_url},window=_blank]

// * and after that:
// +
// image::02/02-01-login2.png[]

* The Red Hat OpenShift AI URL for our shared environment:
** https://rhods-dashboard-redhat-ods-applications.{openshift_cluster_ingress_domain}/[https://rhods-dashboard-redhat-ods-applications.{openshift_cluster_ingress_domain}/,window=_blank]

// * Alternatively, you can access Red Hat OpenShift AI from the OpenShift Console by clicking on:
// +
// [.bordershadow]
// image::02/02-01-access-rhoai.png[]
* Enter your credentials (as detailed above)
* The result should look like:
+
[.bordershadow]
image::02/02-01-login1.png[]

* Because the password is so simple (`{password}`), Chrome might display a scary message such as:

+
[.bordershadow]
image::02/02-01-login-scary.png[]
* It is safe here to ignore this message when it pops up.

* After you authenticate, the result should look like:
+
[.bordershadow]

If you got this far and saw all that, congratulations, you got properly connected to the OpenShift AI Dashboard Application!

// * The `oc login` command:
// [.lines_space]
// [.console-input]
// [source, text]
// [subs=attributes+]
// {login_command}

// == Other credentials and URLs:

// TODO?

// * ArgoCD view
// * Gitea
// * Database
