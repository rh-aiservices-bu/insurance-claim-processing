= Overall Approach

As part of this prototype, we investigated the use of the YOLOV8 model.
This model can be found online at https://www.yolov8.com[yolov8] and downloaded.

We will first review its out-of-the-box capabilities. We will then fine-tune it to allow it to do more specialized work for us. Once we have a new, customized version of the model, we will deploy it in ModelMesh. Once that is done, we will send queries to it.

Let's start by looking at a yolov8 model and explore how it works on static car images.  Please open the notebook called '04-01-over-approach.ipynb'
