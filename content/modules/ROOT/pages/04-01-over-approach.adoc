As part of this prototype, we investigated the use of the YOLOv8 model.
This model can be found online at https://www.yolov8.com[yolov8,window=_blank] and downloaded.

We will first review its out-of-the-box capabilities. We will then fine-tune it to allow it to do more specialized work for us. Once we have a new, customized version of the model, we will deploy it in OpenShift AI Model Serving. Once that is done, we will send queries to it.

Let's start by looking at a YOLOv8 model and explore how it works on static car images.

- In your running workbench, navigate to the folder `insurance-claim-processing/lab-materials/04`.
- Look for (and open) the notebook called `04-01-over-approach.ipynb`
- Execute the cells of the notebook, and ensure you understand what is happening
