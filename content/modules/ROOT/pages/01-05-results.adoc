== Board was convinced!
:slide:

* Great news! The company has decided to fully fund this project!
* We can now move from the prototyping phase to the production phase!
* We have decided to hire all of you fine people to be part of the team that will build and implement the complete solution

== Next steps

We know that you all have various background and responsibilities. (Coders, IT, DevOps, Data Scientists, etc..)
But before you start working in your narrow area of specialization, we want you all to have a decent understanding of all the work that was done during the prototype phase.

The next 75 minutes is your official training session, for you to ramp up and gain an understanding for the various technologies involved during the prototype phase.
