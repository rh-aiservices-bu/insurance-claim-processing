= Model Retraining

. In your running pytorch workbench, navigate to the folder `lab-materials/04`.

. look for the notebook called `04-003-model-retraining.ipynb`

. Execute the cells of the notebook. But note that the actual training step would take way too long on CPU. Stop/terminate the kernel, to free up resources.
